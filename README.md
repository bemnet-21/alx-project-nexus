## âœ… Best Practices & Personal Takeaways

- **Component-Driven Development**: Reusability, modularity, and clarity are key. Components should be small, testable, and focused.
- **Accessibility Matters**: Paying attention to ARIA roles, color contrast, and keyboard navigation improves user experience.
- **Always Document**: Writing meaningful commit messages, README files, and inline comments helped both me and my teammates.
- **Think in Systems**: Frontend isn't just about pretty UI â€” it involves managing data, user flows, and integrating with backends smoothly.
- **Never Stop Iterating**: My mindset evolved from "just make it work" to "make it clean, scalable, and maintainable."
